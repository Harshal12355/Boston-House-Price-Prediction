## Introduction

In this project, we utilize GCP for data storage and processing, specifically using Google Cloud Storage for storing datasets and BigQuery for querying large datasets. We then use Pandas for data manipulation and finally build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the processed data.

## Setup

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with necessary permissions.
- Python environment with necessary libraries (`google-cloud-bigquery`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
- Authentication credentials set up to access GCP services programmatically.

## Data Storage

1. **Upload Data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**:
   - Upload your dataset (e.g., CSV file) to a bucket in GCS using the GCP Console or `gsutil` command-line tool.

   ```bash
   gsutil cp <local-file-path> gs://<your-bucket-name>/<destination-path>
   ```

2. **Verify Upload**:
   - Ensure the data file is successfully uploaded to GCS by checking the bucket through the GCP Console or using `gsutil`.

## Data Querying with BigQuery

1. **Create Dataset and Table in BigQuery**:
   - Use the BigQuery Console or `bq` command-line tool to create a dataset and table schema based on your uploaded data.

   ```sql
   bq mk --dataset <dataset-id>
   bq load --source_format=CSV <dataset-id>.<table-id> gs://<your-bucket-name>/<file-name>.csv
   ```

2. **Query Data**:
   - Write SQL queries in the BigQuery Console or programmatically using the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python library to extract relevant data for analysis.

   ```python
   from google.cloud import bigquery
   
   # Initialize BigQuery client
   client = bigquery.Client()

   # Write and execute SQL query
   query = """
   SELECT * FROM `project_id.dataset_id.table_id`
   """
   df = client.query(query).to_dataframe()
   ```

## Data Manipulation with Pandas

1. **Load Data into Pandas DataFrame**:
   - Use the `to_dataframe()` method from the `google-cloud-bigquery` library to load queried data into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Manipulate data using Pandas
   df_processed = df.copy()  # Example: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X = scaler.fit_transform(df_processed[['feature1', 'feature2', ...]])
   y = df_processed['target']
   ```

## Building the Machine Learning Model

1. **Choose and Train Model**:
   - Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) and train the model using the preprocessed data.

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

2. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) on a test set.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
   ```

## Conclusion

This README provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging GCP services, BigQuery, Pandas, and machine learning to predict house prices. Follow the outlined steps to replicate and extend the project as needed.
